This website demonstrates my understanding of HTML and CSS while giving an overview of me as a professional. This project utilizes Bootstrap and 
a CSS file. It connects to a project I launched on Amazon Web Services, my LinkedIn page and Github page, and a pdf of my resume. The website formated
correctly for both mobile and desktop views.
